# Stanford CS193p Programming Assignment 3 and 4
The following repository contains the source files for the [assignment 3](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/assignment_3_0.pdf) and the [assignment 4](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/assignment_4_0.pdf) for the [CS193p course at Stanford University](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu). 
All the required tasks are completed with the exception of cards flying out of the deck at appearance of the DeckView (part of task 8, assignment 4). The following extra credit tasks are completed, too:  

- Assignment 3:
    - Extra credit task 3.
    - All shapes are made from scratch (albeit the squiggle is actually a rectangle)

- Assignment 4:  
    - Extra credit task 1.
    - Extra credit task 4.

### Satisfactory features:
 - The game plays works as should.
 - Code quality is acceptable with utilization of functional programming concepts.
 - Pretty satisfied with how I managed to generalise the Set Game rules in code.
 - All shapes in cards are drawn (no images).
 - Dynamic shape resizing based on the number of shapes in card.

### Things to improve:
- The animations in this app are very basic and limited.
- The squiggle shape in this implementation of Set Game is actually a rectangle as hinted in the assigment instructions. This was a *make your life easier* feature.

## Final words
Animation system is something that took me the longest time and would definitely benefit from more time invested. After spending unreasonable amount being stuck on the 4th assignment I decided to omit 1 requirement (task 8) in favor of moving on with the course. SwiftUI animation system is something I need to deep dive into.  
Also note that this was the first standalone project done during the CS193p course.
